You interact with the EULA. Terms become increasingly ambiguous as you scroll down, and increasingly small print. Zalgo interrupts you and encourages you to choose neither alternative.

You take your pick or your evasive action.

The Experimenter welcomes you, and "reminds" you that you have been working on an activity to improve your memory. Zalgo interrupts to warn that the images are not innocent

Welcome back! I'm Dr Watts ...
You don't remember me? No matter.
We've been working on mental imagery together. You know the procedure. Shall we continue?

  A card 1-5 ♡, 1♤ 1♢ 1♧ is shown, together with four images.
  There is a word beneath each image. As you roll over the word or the image, they are highlighted and the word is spoken in text-to-speech.

  You have 1 chance in 4 to guess right, then 1 chance in 3 = 0.75 * 0.66 to guess wrong both times = 0.5 of getting it right on the 2nd attempt, 0.25 chance of getting wrong 3 times.

  0.25 right first time
  0.50 right second time
  0.75 right third time
  1.00 right fourth time

That's OK. Take your time. Find the connection in your memory.
You see? You remember.
    
    You're doing no better than chance. It's a lie. You've never done this before, have you?
