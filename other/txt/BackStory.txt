How do cards fit with Zalgo?

I can create card abberations: 
* Use the wrong colour
* Give the wrong number of pips
* Use the wrong pips
* Use a mixture of pips and colours
* Have different card indices at top and bottom
* Create glitches on the way the pips and numbers are shown

I can use a variety of images, and plays on words

Cards represent order, categories and a hierarchy. The powers-that-be want to preserve order and their place in the hierarchy. Zalgo challenges this, and encourages you to be disruptive and creative. The imaginary stories that you create defy order and allow you to control disorder.
