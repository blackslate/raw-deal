    <p>This may look like madness but I am not mad.</p>
    <p>Your grasp of reality and mine are simply different. Perhaps one of us is simply grasping at straws, straws that suck you in, suck you out, suck you dry. Simply. Grasping. Do not succumb.</p>
    <p>Your reality and mind. And mine. Mined. Wind, wound, wounded and the soft wind singing through it all. Each word reaches out to the next, and your mind looks for patterns and meaning, but words themselves are meaningless. Meaning lives only in the spaces between the words, in the attraction and tensions between them. An altered letter, a specific tone, a moment's hesitation overflows with significance.</p>
    <p>I use the same words as you. We have that in common. Are either of us both mad?</p>
    <p>So be careful, be so careful. This document is a contract. If you agree to it, you let yourself be bound when you could be boundless. If you do not agree, then by your own admission you cannot gain admission and you must go back. That is the dilemma: enter or return?</p>
    <p>I am of sound mind and I am of mind to let you in, freely, on your own terms. It is up to you to find the way: the back way in.</p>

  <!-- I do not agree, without even scrolling -->
  <p>You don't even want to try.</p>
  <p>That's fine, you failed the first test anyway. I don't think it would have worked out.</p>
  <p>So long.</p>
</section>

<section id="disagree">
  <!-- I do not agree, after scrolling straight to the end -->
  <p>You're not very adventurous, are you?</p>
  <p>How much richer would your life be, if you simply took the time to pay attention? Perhaps you'll never know.</p>
</section>

<section id="desist">
  <!-- I do not agree, after activating the animation -->
  <p>You give up easily, don't you? The first sign of something unusual and you're gone. </p>
  <p>If you'd stayed, perhaps we could have gained something from each other, but it's your decision.</p>
</section>

<section id="renounce">
  <!-- I do not agree, after the animation completes -->
  <p>You tried. I don't have much hope for you, but at least you tried.</p>
  <p>Choices aren't always black and white. With practice, perhaps you'll discover that there is always another alternative.</p>
</section>

<section id="agree">
  <!-- I agree, after scrolling straight to the end -->
  <p>You agree. That's so nice of you.</p>
  <p>It's disappointing, isn't it, to learn that you have failed the first test? Did you even notice that there was a test? You just gave a conditioned response, like one of Pavlov's dogs.</p>
  <p>OK, I'll give you this chance.</p>
</section>

<section id="hasty">
  <!-- I agree, after activating the animation -->
  <p>Woah! You can slow down. Slow. Down.</p>
  <p>You can take your time to choose wisely. I hope we're not off to a bad start together.</p>
</section>

<section id="consent">
  <!-- I agree, after the animation completes -->
  <p>Life is tricky, isn't it? You always have to make choices, and live by the consequences.</p>
  <p>There was a better choice to make, but you didn't see it. Still, you are full of optimism. There is hope for you yet.</p>
</section>

<section id="enter">
  <!-- Enter or Return, after activating the animation -->
  <p>Yes! I have high hopes for you.</p>
  <p>You pay attention. You notice the details. You take your time to think and decide. Welcome to my world.</p>
</section>

<section id="return">
  <!-- Enter or Return, without activating the animation -->
  <p>You took a shortcut. You've been here before, haven't you? Or was that just a lucky move?</p>
