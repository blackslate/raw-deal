    <p>This may look like madness but I am not mad.</p>
    <p>Your grasp of reality and mine are simply different. Perhaps one of us is simply grasping at straws, straws that suck you in, suck you out, suck you dry. Simply. Grasping. Do not succumb.</p>
    <p>Your reality and mind. And mine. Mined. Wind, wound, wounded and the soft breath of the wind sighing through it all. Each word reaches out to the next, and your mind looks for patterns and meaning, but words themselves are meaningless. Meaning lives only in the empty space between words, in the attraction and tensions between words. An altered letter, a specific tone, a moment's hesitation: each detail overflows with significance.</p>
    <p>I use the same words as you. We have that in common. Are either of us both mad?</p>
    <p>So be careful, be so careful. This document is a contract. Agree to it, and you let yourself be bound when you could be boundless. Do not agree, and then by your own admission you cannot gain admission and you must go back. This is the dilemma you have to resolve: enter or return?</p>
    <p>I am of sound mind and I am of mind to let you in, freely, on your own terms. It is up to you to find your own way back: the back way in.</p>

  <h1>Raw Deal - Summary</h1>
  <p>This is going to become a game where you learn to question everything. For example: there are 9 different ways to deal with the End User License Agreement, and the game will adapt to your behaviour. If you choose the least obvious solution, you'll be told "Welcome to my world".</p>
  <p>Inspired by the <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zalgo">Zalgo</a> meme, this game investigates the boundaries between sanity and creativity, using a colour scheme of reds, white and black.</p>
  <p>We'll write more here as we clarify our ideas about the game.</p>
